# Odin Library

## Goals

- Practice objects and object constructors
- Prototype and prototype inheritance

## Not to Do

- Spending unnecessary time on perfecting its beauty or structure, this is just a project to practice your knowledge, so you can move on as soon as it's *good enough*. That is, you're not supposed to work on your portfolio yet.

## To Do

- Improve the performance of displayLibrary() function, so it doesn't iterate over all the books each time user adds a new book.
